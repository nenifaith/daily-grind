/*

Rotate by Day of Week: Use HTML/CSS & JavaScript to create a single page 
that rotates unique colors and content for each weekday (Sunday to Saturday) 
into the page.  The content must include:

One unique image, with appropriate and matching content in the alt tag.  
A paragraph or two of content that describes the daily item (paragraph 
must include the name of the highlighted weekday)
A unique color that supports the image and paragraph of content

The items we need are :
image (a pic of the coffee)
alt (a description of the pic for people who can't see it)
description (a note about the coffee)
weekday
color (to support the coffee)

The unique color could affect the background HTML, or an element on the page 
for each day of the week.  All of the above must occur within one page.
